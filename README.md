### [Data-driven methodology for discovery and response to pulmonary symptomology in hypertension through statistical learning and data mining: Application to COVID-19 related pharmacovigilance](https://elifesciences.org/articles/70734) 
* Application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials.
* 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1151 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs (pADE).

### [Pulmonary adverse drug event data in hypertension with implicationson COVID‚Äê19 morbidity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92734-7) 
* Hypertension is a recognized comorbidity for COVID‚Äê19. The association of antihypertensive medications with outcomes in patients with hypertension is not fully described.
* Evaluated the occurrence of pulmonary adverse drug events (ADEs) in patients with hypertension receiving ACEIs/ARBs to determine if disparities exist between individual drugs within the respective classes using data from the FDA Spontaneous Reporting Systems.
* Angiotensin‚Äêconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)/Hypertension

* Assessed the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in patients with diabetes who were taking ACEI or ARBs to provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV-2 infection.
